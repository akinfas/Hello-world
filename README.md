# Hello-world
A test project on building a sample database for a Neurology study
This database houses metadata files for a couple of studies I am currently working on the neuro and cardiology files.This consist of 5 studies carried out in my lab.
The first study database is for a randomized double blind study of a drug used to treat HIV to test it's efficacy in preventing HIV replication in vivo.
